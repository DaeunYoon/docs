# Security

## Built on battle-tested technology

The security of the network is paramount, and XION is built on battle-tested technology that secures over $50 billion in assets today. The consensus mechanism was created almost a decade ago and has not suffered any security breaches since its inception. In addition, the tech stack's object-capabilities allow the sandboxing of modules, maximizing the application layer's security.



## Successful audits passed

XION has undergone multiple audits by some of the most respected security firms in the industry, including Halborn and Oak Security.
